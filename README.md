# NPar, a somewhat-opinionated stack 

NPar consists of:
Node.JS 
Polyglot DB 
apollo 
react

Apollo and React are lower caps to call out that there are perfectly good alternatives, for example NPan if you like Angular, and NPrr if you like relay.

##Motivation

It's difficult to create an awesome product.   

##What we provide

(work in progress)

1. Comprehensive set of project templates
2. Curated resources for low decision fatigue, so you can focus on building a great product.
2. Best practices for high-quality and high-performance development

##Principles
1. Do not let tools dictate your process
2. Simplify in all respects 
3. Avoid premature optimization and decisions
4. DRY
5. Create team agreements and practices for high performance

##Opinions

Aside from the basic NPar stack, we provide a comprehensive set of opinions on the best way to build your server and client, as well as tool and deployment recommendations.  

When it makes sense, we also give you alternatives.

Most of these opinions are not documented, but rather they are given in the form of project templates and examples.
